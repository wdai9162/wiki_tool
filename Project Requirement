   •	Article Analytics 
    o	The top two articles with the highest number of revisions and their number of revisions.
    o	The top two articles with the lowest number of revisions and their number of revisions.
    o	The top two articles edited by the largest group of registered users (non bots) and their group size. Each wiki article is edited by a number of users, some making multiple revisions. The number of unique users is a good indicator of an article’s popularity.
    o	The top two articles edited by the smallest group of registered users and their group size.
    o	The top two articles with the longest history (measured by age) and and their age (in days). For each article, the revision with the smallest timestamp is the first revision, indicating the article’s creation time. An article’s age is the duration between now and the article's creation time.
    o	The top two articles with the shortest history (measured by age) and their age (in days).
    o	The user should be provided with a way to change the number of top articles shown, e.g. for highest and lowest number of revisions. The selected number should be applied to all categories above.
